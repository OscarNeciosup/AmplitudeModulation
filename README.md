# ModulationAmplitud
AM modulation in Julia Language.

I wanted to share some about Telecommunications,my most funny course of my Electronic Engineering career. But I need to explain some about Modulation.

## Modulation

In telecommunications, modulation is the process of conveying a message signal, for example a digital bit stream or an analog audio signal, inside another signal that can be physically transmitted. Modulation of a sine waveform transforms a baseband message signal into a passband signal.



In the next days I am going to improve my code and I will try to explain better AM Modulation using Julia.
